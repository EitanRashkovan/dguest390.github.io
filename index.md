_Me learning golf is not as easy as it looks_

## Work
I've spent most of my working career in sales. I found joy in learning how to connect with people from all walks of life;
while also allowing me to travel around the country working and living in multiple states.
#### My primary sales industries
- Security/Automation
  - Worked in both residential and commercial. Providing owners protection and allowing more control over their property through technology.
- Solar
  - Worked in provding owners with a lower energy bill while also moving to a source that's renewable

## School
After Learning how to connect with people and getting the "travel bug" out of my system, I realized that I wanted to work on something more than just conversations.
I found myself spending my free time learning about technology and was fascinated how this is the most advanced field I will get to witness in my life time.
I just wanted to be a part of it.
#### This is how it started
1. Picked up Learning Python by [Mark Lutz](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-5th/9781449355722/)
2. This gave me a glimpse into programming and sparked the interest to pursue more
3. Thought about going to a bootcamp for web development
4. Decided an Associate's Degree would give me a better start so enrolled in a Computer Science AS
5. After making it through most of the degree I felt it didn't cover enough material
6. Thought about going to a bootcamp for web development
7. Decided if this is going to be my path for the rest of my life I should get the strongest foundation possible
8. Currently part way through my junior year of a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and loving it

## Hobbies
There are two other hobbies I put serious thought into turning into my future career. They aren't evolving at the remarkable pace technology is,
but they are still fun to keep me intrested for a bit from time to time.
##### The two other fields I enjoy but prefer to keep to hobbies
- Fitness
  - Really anything that gets the body moving such as running, weight lifting, or rock climbing
- Mycology
  - From learning about the complexities of different fungi, to hunting for edible species in the wild, to growing my own, I find mycology quite interesting.
